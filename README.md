# Relocation Feasibility Portal using Cost of Living Data

This repository contains the group work for the final project for Indiana University's DSCI-D532 class. This project creates a portal for assisting users in making financially-informed relocation decisions by using a dataset from Kaggle that details the cost of living of over 4,500 cities globally. Users will input a salary and their ideal budget breakdown for various categories of expenses in order to produce a list of places that best accommodate their preferences.
